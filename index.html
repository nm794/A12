    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;</blockquote>
